# fall-2025

A catch-all repository for my classes taken in the fall of 2025.

Using Jupyter Notebooks for a majority of my classes as well as storing all the lecture slides, readings, exam reviews, etc. Switching from Notion to better learn Git and version control.

## Setting up a Python environment

All of my notes will be written in a Jupyter Notebook due to ease of writing Python code with full support of Latex as well (which is really nice).

```
python3 -m venv env
source path/to/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install xyz
```
